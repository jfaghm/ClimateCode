\section{Introduction}
Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have well documented global long-range teleconnections, including Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) activity \cite{gray1984a, bove1998,elsner2001b, emanuel2008, klotzbach2011nino}. The quasi-periodic cycle (2-7 years) of warming and cooling of the near equatorial Pacific Ocean, known as the El-Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO), has been used to predict Atlantic TC activity for decades. However, due to the large amplitude variations in seasonal TC counts, the difference in Atlantic TC activity based on the phase of ENSO is not obvious (see Figure \ref{fig:enso_bars}).

Traditionally, ENSO has been quantified using warming-based indices where SST anomalies are averaged over fixed regions in the Pacific Ocean. An increasing number of studies suggest that monitoring static regions may not be enough to capture the complex ENSO phenomenon \cite{trenberth2001, ashok2007,yeh2009,kim2009}. Furthermore, other studies proposed that the Pacific Ocean warming patterns are changing - with warm anomalies shifting towards the Central Pacific. Such changes have been attributed to anthropogenic global warming \cite{yeh2009} as well as natural climate variability \cite{wittenberg2009}. Based on these findings, it is evident that in order to capture ENSO's long range impact on the tropical Atlantic a new measure of Pacific warming is needed. We propose a novel spatial ENSO index (S-ENSO) that is designed specifically to capture the physical pathways by which Pacific SSTs may influence Atlantic TC activity. Tropical Atlantic SST variability is correlated with Pacific ENSO variability in several regions. The major region affected is the North Atlantic area west of 40W along $10N - 20N$ and extending into the Caribbean. There, about 50-80\% of the anomalous SST variability is associated with ENSO \cite{enfield97}. The influence of ENSO in the prediction skill over the tropical Atlantic is also consistent with the ENSO teleconnection over the tropical Atlantic in both observations and model simulations \cite{hu12}. However, the ENSO phenomenon is more complex than can be explained by a locally fixed index \cite{kim2009}, and TC activity can be influenced by other remote SST changes \cite{vecchi2007effect}.

Previous work investigating the ENSO-Atlantic TC teleconnection proposed that enhanced convection as a result of anomalous Pacific Ocean warming during the El Niño phase is associated with strong westerly upper tropospheric wind over the Caribbean basin and tropical Atlantic, resulting in low TC activity during ENSO's warm phase (El Ni\~{n}o) events and high TC activity during its cold phase (La Ni\~{n}a). because positive (warm) eastern Pacific SST and negative (drought) Sahelian rainfall anomalies are associated with suppressed Atlantic basin tropical cyclone activity through an equatorially confined near-zonal circulation with upper-level westerlies and lower-level easterlies that act to increase the climatological westerly vertical shear in the main development region \cite{goldenberg1996physical}. Other studies have suggested that ENSO impact Atlantic TC activity via tropospheric warming \cite{tang2004}, since warm free tropospheric temperatures that are spread eastward from the Pacific by equatorial wave dynamics (e.g. Kelvin waves) can inhibit TC activity by providing a too weak vertical temperature gradient for TC activity to occur. Analogous to reduced vertical temperature gradient, a reduced vertical gradient of saturation deficit suppresses vertical mixing and thus negatively affects TC activity.



%It has been proposed that enhanced convection as a result of anomalous Pacific Ocean warming is associated with strong westerly upper tropospheric wind over the Caribbean basin and tropical Atlantic, resulting in low TC activity during ENSO's warm phase and high TC activity during its cold phase \cite{gray1984}. Other studies have suggested that ENSO impacts Atlantic TC activity via tropospheric warming \cite{tang2004}.

Our approach introduces a distance-based ENSO index that tracks the location of maximum near-tropical Pacific warming anomaly instead of its absolute warming. We will demonstrate the performance of our index by comparing it to traditional warming-based ENSO indices in discriminating between the large-scale conditions that are favorable for Atlantic cyclogenesis. 


%Given its long-range teleconnections, as well as ENSO being the most dominant feature of cyclic climate variability on subdecadal timescales, effectively abstracting and predicting Pacific Ocean warming anomalies has been a subject of active research.




%Such indices include the Nino 1+2 (0-10S, 90-80W), Nino 3 (5N-5S, 150-90W), Nino 4 (5N-5S, 160E-150W), and Nino 3.4 (5N-5S, 170-120W) regions. Some studies have suggested such indices do not capture ENSO's nature and evolution. Subsequently, more elaborate indices were developed some of which were linear combinations of the above-mentioned indices \cite{trenberth2001}, while others have proposed indices using transformed data or nonlinear combination of indices \cite{ren2011}. Despite the varying degrees of complexity, the majority of works attempting to capture ENSO focus on the intensity of warming in a the tropical Pacific. While such indices might provide valuable insight into weather teleconnections, they were not designed to capture the physical pathways by which Pacific SSTs may impact the large-scale conditions over the Atlantic. Recent hurricane downscaling studies \cite{knutson2007simulation, emanuel2010comparison} as well as genesis indices \cite{menkes2012comparison} have shown that the large scale environment over the Atlantic might play a dominant role in modulating Atlantic TC activity than precursor disturbances, since these simulations do not model such disturbances yet are able to reproduce Atlantic TC climatology with significant accuracy. Therefore, increasing our ability to predict the large-scale environment over the Atlantic could have significant scientific and societal value.



%One of the ENSO teleconnections is with North Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) activity. The influence of ENSO on Atlantic TCs is well documented \cite{gray1984a, bove1998, elsner2001b,klotzbach2011nino}, however due to the large amplitude variations of seasonal counts, the difference in Atlantic TC activity based on the various phases of ENSO is not obvious (see Figure \ref{fig:enso_bars}).

%Given its long-range teleconnections, as well as ENSO being the most dominant feature of cyclic climate variability on subdecadal timescales, effectively abstracting and predicting Pacific Ocean warming anomalies has been a subject of active research. 


\section{Spatial ENSO Index (S-ENSO)}
We propose that the spatial distribution of Pacific Ocean warming might provide better predictive insights into ENSO-Atlantic TC activity relationship than warming anomalies alone. S-ENSO is a distance-based ENSO index that tracks the longitudinal location of highest SST anomaly in the tropical Pacific. We also track the mean Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) of the identified region to monitor the atmospheric deep convection associated with such anomalies. The S-ENSO index is computed by first averaging the SST anomalies over the March-October period to accurately capture ENSO's evolution prior to and during the Atlantic hurricane season (August-October). We then search the tropical Pacific ($5^\circ$S-$30^\circ$N) for a region of similar size than traditional ENSO indices that has the highest mean SST anomaly over the March-October (see figure \ref{fig:s_enso_graphic}). Once such a region is identified, we compute the mean OLR over that region and use it as a single entry in the index. We repeat this procedure for each year from 1979 to 2010. Table \ref{} shows S-ENSO's linear correlation coefficients with various quantities that communicate August-October Atlantic TC activity: number of tropical cyclones, number of major hurricanes, potential dissipation index (PDI) \cite{emanuel2005a}, accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) \cite{Bell2000}, and net tropical cyclone energy (NTC) \cite{goldenberg2001}.

	\caption{A schematic demonstrating how the S-ENSO index is built. First, SST anomalies over March-October are computed resulting in maps similar to those above. Next, we search the tropical Pacific for the region with the highest mean SST warming anomaly over March-October. Finally, we record the longitude of that region. We repeat this procedure for all years from 1979-2010. }

% distance between the location of maximum and minimum Pacific tropical warming anomalies instead of the absolute warming of a static region. The S-ENSO index consists of four factors: (i) the longitudinal distance between the warmest and coldest SST anomaly pool in the tropical Pacific, (ii) the mean Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) of the warmest SST anomaly region in the tropical Pacific to monitor atmospheric deep convection, (iii) the mean surface pressure of the warmest SST anomaly region in the tropical Pacific, and (iv) the longitude of the minimal pressure region in the tropical Pacific to approximate Pacific tropical cyclone (typhoon) activity. The S-ENSO index is computed, by first averaging each variable over the March-October then building each of the four indices separately. Then we sum the normalized indices into a single S-ENSO index. For each year from 1979-2011, we search for the region of maximum and minimum warming anomaly in regions of size comparable to that of warming-based ENSO indices. The time series of the longitude of the PWP is then correlated with various quantities that communicate August-October Atlantic TC activity: number of tropical cyclones, number of major hurricanes, potential dissipation index (PDI) \cite{emanuel2005a}, accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) \cite{Bell2000}, and net tropical cyclone energy (NTC) \cite{goldenberg2001}.

% Given that S-ENSO's performance depends on the month range over which the index is computed, we performed a month range sensitivity analysis to asses the robustness of our results with respect to month range selection. For every possible month range, we computed the S-ENSO, NINO1.2, NINO3, NINO4, and NINO3.4 indeces to correlated them with August-October Atlantic TC activity. Figure \ref{fig:tc_sensitivity} shows the month range sensitivity tests for NINO1.2, NINO3, NINO4, NINO3.4, and S-ENSO. Each cell color represents the the linear correlation coefficients between August-October TC Atlantic TC activity and the index computed over a given start and end month. S-ENSO performs significantly better than especially with increased lead times as NINO indices suffer from a ``predictability barrier" that make it difficult to use them to predict TC activity before June \cite{webster1992}.

% \subsection{Lead times}
% To test the robustness of our indices, we also increased computed the correlation between our indices and Atlantic TC activity with increasing lead times. Tables \ref{ref:lead_tc} and  \ref{ref:lead_hurr} show the correlations as a function of lead time for ASO TC and major hurricane counts respectively. The Combo Index has limited long range prediction as it doesn't have much skill until July for both hurricanes and TCs. Our SST-based indices (PWP-lon and PWP-PCP) have better long-range predictability. Our improvement over major NINO indices is significant with increased lead time (up to an order of magnitude better in some cases). This improvement is because traditional ENSO indices suffer from a ``predictability barrier" that make it difficult to use them to predict TC activity before June \cite{webster1992}. However, it is important to note that one static region in the Pacific (Modoki Box C) has good long-range correlations to both TCs and major hurricanes. However, that region alone isn't known to be used to TC or hurricane prediction. Another interesting observation, is the high correlation with both TCs and major hurricanes for the Jan-Dec month range for the Combo Index.

We built a linear regression model using a leave k-out cross validation ($k=1,2,4,8$) Tables \ref{ref:l1o_corr} - \ref{ref:l8o_corr} show the results. We can see that our Combo Index is very robust regardless of how many observations are held out during training.

It seems that straight non-random cross-validation might not fully address the ``Faghmous Paradox''

\section{S-ENSO's impact on large-scale conditions over the Atlantic}
To propose possible physical pathways by which our index impact Atlantic TC activity, we compute the composites for factors known to influence Atlantic TC activity: potential intensity (PI), saturation deficit between the mid- and lower-troposphere and vertical wind shear between 850 and 200 hPa. (also not shown we have composites for SST, central pressure, geopotential height and precipitable water). Each composite was for the August-October period - the peak hurricane season. To compare how well our index resolves the large-scale conditions that are critical to seasonal TC activity we compare our index' composites to those of the seasonal TC count composites (baseline) and those of the most common warming-based ENSO index: NINO3.4. The idea is that if our index is better able to distinguish between the large-scale conditions for active and inactive hurricane seasons its composites should closely resemble those of the baseline (i.e. active minus inactive hurricane years). Furthermore, Recent hurricane downscaling studies \cite{knutson2007simulation, emanuel2010comparison} as well as genesis indices \cite{menkes2012comparison} have shown that the large scale environment over the Atlantic might play a dominant role in modulating Atlantic TC activity than precursor disturbances, since these simulations do not model such disturbances yet are able to reproduce Atlantic TC climatology with significant accuracy.

Figure \ref{fig:olr_comp} shows the composites for PI (top row), the difference in saturation deficit between 500 and 850 hPa (middle row), and vertical wind shear between 200 and 850 hPa (bottom) row. Each column shows the composites for hurricane counts (left), NINO3.4 (middle), and S-ENSO (right). $95\%$ significance intervals are shaded.

Figure \ref{fig:pi_comp_vs_olr} shows the PI composite. S-ENSO is able to reproduce nearly identical conditions to those of the TC count composite. In figure \ref{fig:sat_def_comp} a linear combination of the S-ENSO and OLR is also able to reproduce the large-scale saturation deficit in the lower and middle troposphere. These results show that monitoring the spatial warming patterns of the tropical pacific can significantly increase our ability to resolve the large-scale conditions over the Atlantic during the hurricane season.

\section{Acknowledgments}
We thank Prof. David Nolan for providing us with the MATLAB routines to compute potential intensity (PI) from reanalysis data.

% Figures \ref{fig:pres_comp} - \ref{fig:figure37} show the composites (active years minutes inactive years) for NINO3.4 (top), Combo Index (middle) and ground truth (bottom).
% \subsubsection{Central Pressure}
% Tropical cyclones are low pressure systems, therefore seasons with high TC activity tend to have low pressure means as seen in Figure \ref{fig:pres_comp}. Our index is able to resolve much lower central pressure across the Atlantic Main Development Region (MDR) than the NINO3.4 index. It is not clear from this composite whether high TC activity is a cause or effect of large-scale low pressure.
% 
% 
% \subsubsection{Potential Intensity (PI)}
% Potential intensity is a variable computed by combining the column integrated air temperature and relative humidity. PI has been shown to provide the theoretical upper bound on storm intensity given air temperature and relative humidity \cite{emanuel1999}. PI has also been used as a proxy of how conducive an environment is for tropical cyclogenesis \cite{emanuel2008}. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:pi_comp} (bottom), active TC seasons tend to have high PI values along the MDR especially right off the West African coast where African Easterly Waves (AEWs) exit the continental mass. Similar to central pressure, our index (Figure \ref{fig:pi_comp} middle panel) resolves similar spatial patterns for PI than the ground truth.

% \subsubsection{Relative Humidity (RH)}
% In order for TCs to develop a minimal amount of moisture must be present in the vertical column \cite{emanuel1999}. That is why active TC seasons tend to have high RH in the East Atlantic where most hurricane form (figure \ref{fig:rh850_comp}). While our index resolves the conditions over the Atlantic better than NINO3.4 (Figure \ref{fig:rh850_comp} top), it over estimate RH in the Western Atlantic. Other moisture variables to look into are precipitable water and saturation deficit. 
% 
% \subsubsection{Sea Surface Temperatures (SST)}
% Our index is particularly better at resolving seasonal SSTs compared to NINO3.4.

% \subsection{ENSO Overview}
% The quasi-periodic cycle (2-7 years) of warming and cooling of the near equatorial Pacific Ocean, known as the El-Ni\~no Souther Oscillation (ENSO) is associated with anomalous atmospheric circulation and alterations to the Eastern Pacific thermocline (the subsurface boundary between upper warm waters and deep cool waters). During its warm, El-Ni\~no (EN) phase, the equatorial Pacific Ocean experiences weak easterly winds causing an increase in Eastern Pacific SSTs, that in turn alters the atmospheric zonal (Walker) circulation, generally resulting in prevailing westerlies. ENSO's cold, La Ni\~na (LN) phase, is characterized by the opposite atmospheric conditions -- with cold SST anomalies along the Eastern Pacific and warm ones near the Western Pacific as a result of prevailing easterly winds (see Figure \ref{fig:enso_cartoon}). The mechanisms that control the reversal to the opposite LN phase are not fully understood \cite{kirtman1997,smith2012}. Recent research has suggested that to fully capture ENSO activity, it is no longer sufficient to monitor the warm and cold phases in the Eastern Pacific. Instead, warming patterns in the Central Pacific must be monitored as well \cite{ashok2007}. Warming in the Central Pacific, known as El Ni\~no Modoki, where a warm waters are surrounded by cold ones has been observed with increased frequency since the 1990s. Such changes have been attributed to anthropogenic global warming \cite{yeh2009} as well as natural climate variability \cite{wittenberg2009}.
% 
% Enhanced convection as a result of anomalous Pacific Ocean warming is associated with strong westerly upper tropospheric wind over the Caribbean basin and tropical Atlantic, resulting in low TC activity during EN events and high TC activity LN \cite{gray1984a}. Other studies have suggested that ENSO impact Atlantic TC activity via tropospheric warming \cite{tang2004}.

%In fact, recent research has attributed increased accuracy in predicting seasonal TC activity with reasonable lead times to an increased ability to predict Pacific SSTs \cite{smith2010}.$

%The warming anomalies of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) along the near-equatorial Pacific Ocean have well documented global long-range weather teleconnections from rainfall in southern India to mudslides in the western United States. 

% Hurricanes, or more generally tropical cyclones (TCs), are one of the most devastating natural disasters in terms of both human and material loss. Therefore there is significant scientific and societal interest in understanding how will TC activity (frequency, intensity, and trajectories) evolve especially under global warming conditions. Our understanding our future TC activity under various warming scenarios is limited \cite{knutson2010} mainly due to two major questions: First, how will the large scale conditions over TC development regions evolve if the environment continues to warm; (ii) and if we can predict such conditions what would future TC activity be as a response to such large-scale changes? Subsequently, to understand future Atlantic TC activity, we must first understand how will the large-scale conditions over the Atlantic change and how will Atlantic TCs respond to such changes.

%Tables \ref{table:april_lead} through \ref{table:oct_lead} show the linear correlation coefficients between August-October TC Atlantic TC activity and our ENSO spatial index for Feb-April, April-June, and August-October respectively. In all cases our spatial ENSO index correlates better than traditional warming-based indices. The improvements increase as we increase lead time, with April lead times improving by more than an order of magnitude. This improvement is because traditional ENSO indices suffer from a ``predictability barrier" that make it difficult to use them to predict TC activity before June \cite{webster1992}.

\subsection{Sensitivity Tests}
To validate our results, we test the sensitivity of our results to the month ranges used to build the index, the size of the ENSO box used, the size of the search space, and the months used as TC season. As it can be seen from the figures below, our results are stable with respect to parameter choice, except for search space where the correlations chance drastically based on which region we search.
